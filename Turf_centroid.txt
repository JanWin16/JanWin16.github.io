The self-generated turf function can be found directly next to the function from the data which is located at the geography building.

The turf.centroid() function calculates the geometric center (center of mass) of a polygon. It analyzes the shape's area and returns a point that represents its balance point. This centroid may lie outside the polygon for irregular shapes, as itâ€™s based on overall geometry, not position within the shape.
This is useful for spatial analysis tasks like labeling, mapping central locations, or summarizing the position of a geographic area.
